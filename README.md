# Initial Setup

Extract the content you unzip from the folders `/DBahn-berlin/timetable` and `/DBahn-berlin/timetable_changes` respectively into folders named `/timetable` and `/timetable_changes`. So the folder structure looks like the following:

```
.
├── DBahn-berlin
│   ├── ...
│   ├── timetable_changes
│   └── timetables
├── ...
├── timetable_changes
└── timetables
```

The folders `/timetable` and `/timetable_changes` will be gitignored.
